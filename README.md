## Restaurant Page

This is a one page application designed to display basic information about a restaurant. It is made up of the initial page load which has tabs for home, menu, contact, and about modules. JavaScript CodeS are written for each module. This scripts creates and loads the html elements and page when clicked. Each tab also displays the right information about the page. Webpack compiles the JavaScript code written in ES6 to a version that can be read by most browsers.
